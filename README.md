# Trader Sentiment Analysis 
A data science project exploring how trader behavior (profitability, risk, and volume) correlates with market sentiment using Hyperliquid trade data and the Fear–Greed Index dataset(2018–2025).

# Highlights
- Merged 200k+ trades with sentiment data to analyze behavioral bias.
- Found that Greed phases correlate with higher volume but not higher profit.
- Built visual analytics and daily aggregates using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Deliverables
- `notebook_1.ipynb` – complete Colab workflow
- `csv_files/` – daily and account-level summaries
- `outputs/` – visual charts
- `ds_report.pdf` – final analytical report
